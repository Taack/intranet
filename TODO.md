# Intranet TODO and DONE. 

Should be commited separately to have a clean history

## Attachment

* ~~Separate Attachment from Attachment Meta data~~
* Batch processing (index, distribute)
* Manage file history
* Manage **fine-grained** file update (binary diff, text diff, compression)
* Attachment renderer
  - WebGL STEP via FreeCAD
  - QCad / libreCAD 2D Drawing
* Fix the file path when updating. The same way as for O2M, with preview
* Folders (file group associated with an object, hierarchical)

## Crew

* ~~Improve picture management~~
* ~~Security via closures~~
* Improve grouping, tree when paginates
* ~~PDF organization chart with photographs~~

## PLM

* Use Attachment Metadata
* Steps 3D preview
* Search fulltext
* Start 3D DSL / Sketcher / OCCT binding
* Specify local agent for data exchange
* (Maybe!) store files as attachments
  * API to manage Attachment as PLM files
  * **OR** API to manage PLM files as Attachments

## Intercom

* Editable File templates
* Support for asciidoc Addons (Stats3 charts, Forms and lists of objects)
* ~~Use attachment Meta data for security~~

## Stats

* manage external DS
* support groups, complex sorts
* operations on string and BigDecimal
* Cross-tables

## Edges

* Infra to upload sets of files
* Attach those files to other objects
* Local agents on edge computers
* Make Attachment related service compatible with edge data

## Scheduler

* DSL scheduler
* SystemD DBUS API usage
* reverse SSH
* Depends on Edges
